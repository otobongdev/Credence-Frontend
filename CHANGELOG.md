and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`Toggle` loading/error/retry/stale/permission states** (`src/components/controls/Toggle.tsx`): `error` is now surfaced rather than only styled (rendered message with `role="alert"`, linked through `aria-describedby`, and suppressed when the caller already supplies a description such as `FormField` does); `isLoading` sets `aria-busy` and announces `loadingLabel` through a polite live region; new optional `onRetry`/`retryLabel` render a retry affordance that re-runs a failed save without ever flipping the value and is disabled while a request is in flight; `isStale`/`staleMessage` annotate an out-of-date value without disabling the control; `disabledReason` explains a permission/read-only refusal as visible, described text; the switch is always `type="button"` so it can no longer submit a surrounding `<form>`; interaction is refused inside the click handler as well as through the `disabled` attribute; the wrapper exposes a single `data-state`. All new props are optional, so existing callers are unaffected (`Settings.tsx`, `AnalyticsWidget.tsx` pass only `checked`/`onChange`/`ariaLabel`/`id`).
- **Adverse-condition coverage for `Toggle`**: `src/components/controls/Toggle.boundary.test.tsx` (prop/state matrix, ARIA coercion, describedBy merging, interaction refusals, form-submit regression, concurrent clicks, unique generated ids) and `src/components/controls/Toggle.recovery.test.tsx` (a controlled save-lifecycle harness covering double-click serialisation, rejection without false success, optimistic rollback, retry and repeated-failure recovery, permission refusal and re-grant, failed revalidation, and a revalidation that resolves after a newer write).

### Added

- **Exact decimal amounts at the API boundary** (`src/api/amount.ts`, `src/api/client.ts`): new `BigInt`-only decimal engine plus an opt-in `amountFields` option on `apiFetch`. Declared amount fields are validated (plain unsigned decimal grammar, scale, sign, int64 scaled-integer overflow, optional `min`/`max`) and serialized as canonical decimal strings (`1000.5` → `'1000.50'`) matching the `Bond.amount` contract in `openapi.yaml`. Invalid amounts reject with a typed `ApiAmountError` (synthetic `status: 400`, structured `field`/`code`) **before** the rate limiter or the network is touched, and the caller's body object is never mutated. Excess precision is rejected (`INVALID_SCALE`), never rounded. Calls that omit `amountFields` keep byte-identical previous behavior. Design, invariants, compatibility, and rollback notes: [docs/AMOUNT_PRECISION.md](docs/AMOUNT_PRECISION.md); tests: `src/api/amount.test.ts` (unit + seeded property tests against an independent oracle) and `src/api/client.test.ts` (integration boundary).
- **`parseAmount` / `tryParseAmount` / `compareAmounts` / `resolveAmountRules`** exported from `src/api`: exact-decimal helpers UI code can reuse for live validation and comparisons without duplicating the rules. Also fixes a latent `isolatedModules` type error in the `src/api/index.ts` barrel (`ApiFetchOptions` re-exported as a value).

### Refactored

- **`useLocalStorage<T>` hook** (`src/hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`): generic hook that encapsulates the read/parse/fallback pattern for localStorage. SSR-safe (`window` guard), corrupt-JSON-tolerant, and treats falsy-but-valid stored values (`false`, `0`, `""`) correctly. Returns a stable `[value, setValue]` tuple where `setValue` writes through to localStorage synchronously. Pure helpers `resolveStoredValue` and `writeToStorage` are also exported for testing.
- **`SettingsContext`**: replaced the ad-hoc `loadSavedSettings` + five `useState` lazy-init blocks with a single `useLocalStorage<PersistedSettings>` call so the parse-on-mount happens once. Also extracted a `useMigrateLegacyTheme` hook that runs synchronously (before the first `useLocalStorage` read) to absorb any orphaned `theme` key into `credence:settings`. Public `SettingsState` shape and `STORAGE_KEY` are unchanged.

### Added

- `src/lib/penalty.ts`: extracted `BondStatus`, `MockBond`, `getPenaltyRate`, and `computeWithdrawBreakdown` into a shared module, making the penalty math the single source of truth for Bond.tsx and ConfirmDialog.
- `src/lib/penalty.test.ts`: unit tests for all penalty rates and breakdown arithmetic (active/grace-period/locked, zero-penalty path, fractional amounts).
- `ApiError.code` (`src/api/client.ts`): optional `invalid_request_url | network_error | http_error` classification on `ApiError`, so callers can tell a permanent programming fault from a retryable network blip. Additive — existing three-argument `ApiError` construction is unchanged.
- `buildUrl` and `normalizeBaseUrl` exported from `src/api/client.ts` so the URL failure boundaries are directly testable. `import.meta.env` is inlined at build time, so `VITE_API_BASE_URL` cannot be stubbed from a test.
- `src/api/client.test.ts`: failure-boundary coverage for URL building (224 tests), gated at 100% statements/branches/functions/lines in `vite.config.ts`.

### Security

- `buildUrl` now rejects origin-relative paths (`//host`, `///bonds`) and backslash paths (`/\host`, `/a\..\b`). The WHATWG URL parser resolves all of these to a **different origin**, so they previously turned an in-app path into a cross-origin request carrying default headers and cookies. Empty, non-string, control-character, and fragment-containing paths are now rejected with a typed `ApiError` instead of being silently rewritten by the URL parser (for example `/bonds\nx` collapsing to `/bondsx`, or `/bonds#other` fetching a different resource).
- `normalizeBaseUrl` fails closed to same-origin for a scheme-relative, scheme-less, non-http(s), unparseable, or query/fragment-carrying `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, instead of silently sending every API request to another host. The rejected value is never echoed to the console because a base URL may embed credentials.
- Added a reusable infinite-query wrapper for cursor-based feeds in [`src/hooks/useInfiniteQuery.ts`](src/hooks/useInfiniteQuery.ts).
- Documented the new pagination helper in the main README and docs index.
- **`useDebouncedValue` documentation** (`docs/HOOKS.md`): catalog entry covering the central-place search/filter debouncer — signature, parameter table, behavior notes (restart-on-change, `delayMs <= 0` short-circuit, referential stability, testable via injected timers), SSR/cleanup contract, and a Trust-search example.
- **`useOnceMounted` documentation** (`docs/HOOKS.md`): catalog entry covering the StrictMode-safe run-once guard — signature, behavior notes (StrictMode double-invoke via `calledRef`, true-remount rebinds, latest-callback-wins via ref, optional cleanup, synchronous error propagation), and an analytics `route_view` example.
- **CHANGELOG merge conflict markers removed**: the long-standing `<<<<<<< Updated upstream` / `=======` / `>>>>>>> Stashed changes` block under `[Unreleased]` is resolved by taking the union of both sides (they were non-overlapping additions from different PRs).

### Changed

- `Bond.tsx`: imports penalty helpers from `src/lib/penalty.ts`; `slashBannerBreakdown` is now memoized with `useMemo` to avoid recomputing on unrelated renders.
- **`useDebouncedValue<T>`** (`src/hooks/useDebouncedValue.ts`): added an optional third `options` argument exposing `setTimeoutImpl` / `clearTimeoutImpl` — the same injectable-timer pattern already used by `useCopyToClipboard`. Backwards-compatible (defaults preserve the existing global-timer behaviour); enables per-test assertion of timer scheduling without `vi.mock` of the module. The implementations are captured in refs so the effect only re-runs on `value` / `delayMs` changes (callers may pass inline function literals without thrashing the effect). Errors from a throwing `clearTimeoutImpl` are caught so a broken test double cannot crash the render path.
